# Tech Lab
The purpose of this project is to consolidate solutions for all DS & Algorithm based questions that I've came across either online (websites like HackerRank) or Book(books like Cracking The Code). I actively use this project as my tech lab to experiment and implement common questions asked in tech interviews.

### Development
The project is a standard Android project since Android Studio has been used as IDE for develpoment purpose. However, the project has separate java module so that it can be run and compiled as stand alone java project.

### What it includes?
The project has following sub-modules:
- Algorithm: All major searching and sorting algorithms
- Data Structures: Custom basic implementation of common data structures (Arrays, Linked List, Stacks, Queues, Trees Graphs)
- Solution: Solution for technical questions
